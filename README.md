Gravifour
=========

Gravifour is a kind of board game. There exists a physical prototype, known under many names, including "Gravitrips". Variations of it can also be played on paper with pencil. 

The game is played by two players, X and O, who take turns dropping their pieces into a vertical 8 pieces wide and 6 pieces high board. The player who successedes placing four his pieces in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game. Once the lowest row is filled entirely, it disappears, like in Tetris, all the remaining pieces moving one position down. If some column appears entirely filled by pieces, it looses it's lowest piece, the rest of the column moving one position down. Thus, there is always a space for next move and no notion of a "draw".

I'll implement the game, try to play it and investigate possible winning strategies. I don't know yet, if solving the game won't make adjust the rules, so that it isn't too straightforward.
